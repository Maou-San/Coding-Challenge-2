Coding Challenge 2

In a stream of text, a Three Letter Sequence, or “TLS” is defined as a sequence of three consecutive alphabetical characters, where consecutive means uninterrupted by non-alphabetical characters such as whitespace, punctuation, etc. So, for example, the follow text:
“hello, what’s up?”
Contains exactly 5 TLSs:
hel , ell , llo , wha , hat
TLSs are case-insensitive so that, for example, “Aar” is the same TLS as “aar”. There are therefore 26^3 = 17,576 possible distinct TLSs in English.

Input:
An number (of occurrances of a tls in the file)
And a file (by default at: "E:\Github\Coding Challenge 2\Coding Challenge 2\tls.txt"

Output:
This program prints on the console the TLS that appear the corresponding number of times in the file
